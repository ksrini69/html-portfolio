<h1>The Best Movies according to Venkatesh Krishnan</h1>

<h2>The three best movies of all time</h2>

<hr /> 

<h3>Sholay</h3>

<p>This is one of the best bandit movies of all time. Wonderful acting by all concerned. Still so relevant today</p>

<h3>Kuch Kuch Hota Hai</h3>

<p>A lovely movie by Shah Rukh Khan. Shows a coming of age movie and romance with a real lovely angle to it.</p>

<h3>Paheli</h3>

<p>Only term to describe this is "Wow". I really liked it due to its theme and the acting. </p>
